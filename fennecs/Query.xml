            <br/>Delegate for Query runner actions that take an Entity and references to Component data.
            Entity can be used to make structural changes as needed. They will be queued in the World and then executed once the runner returns.

        <remarks>
            The EntityAction variant is provided to make it eas to schedule structural changes from within a runner.

        <remarks>
            There's no EntityAction variant of <c>Query.Job</c>, but you can use the Identity component and <c>World.On(Identity)</c> to perform entity operations.
            Generally, structural changes are deferred and executed single-threaded after the Job runner returns. Consider using <c>Query.Batch</c> instead to keep your Jobs running as fast as they can.
