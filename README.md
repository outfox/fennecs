## Quickstart: Let's go!
📦`>` `dotnet add package fennecs`

At the basic level, all you need is a 🧩**component type**, a number of ~~small foxes~~ 🦊**entities**, and a query to ⚙️**iterate and modify** components, occasionally passing in some uniform 💾**data**.

```csharp
// Declare your own component types. (you can also use most existing value or reference types)
using Position = System.Numerics.Vector3;

// Create a world. (fyi, World implements IDisposable)
var world = new fennecs.World();

// Spawn an entity into the world with a choice of components. (or add/remove them later)
var entity = world.Spawn().Add<Position>();

// Queries are cached, just build them right where you want to use them.
var query = world.Query<Position>().Build();

// Run code on all entities in the query. (omit chunksize to parallelize only by archetype)
query.Job(static (ref Position position, float dt) => {
    position.Y -= 9.81f * dt;
}, uniform: Time.Delta, chunkSize: 2048);
```

#### 💢... when we said minimal boilerplate, <em>we meant it.</em>
Even using the strictest judgment, that's no more than 2 lines of boilerplate! Merely instantiating the world and building the query aren't directly moving parts of the actor/gravity feature we just built, and should be seen as "enablers" or "infrastructure".  

The 💫*real magic*💫 is that none of this brevity compromises on performance.

## 🥊 Comparisons: Punching above our weight?
So how does _**fenn**ecs_ compare to other ECSs? 

This library is a tiny, tiny ECS with a focus on good performance and great simplicity. But it *cares enough* to provide a few things you might not expect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The idea of _**fenn**ecs_ was to fill the gaps that the author felt working with various established Entity Component Systems. This is why this matrix is clearly imbalanced, it's a shopping list of things that _**fenn**ecs_ does well and was made to do
well; and things it may aspire to do but compromised on in order to be able to achieve the others.

## 💡Highlights / Design Goals

- [x] Modern C# 12 codebase, targeting .NET 8.
- [x] Full Unit Test coverage.
- [ ] Benchmarking suite. (Work in Progress)

- [x] Workloads can be easily parallelized across *and within* Archetypes

- [x] Expressive, queryable relations between Entities and Objects
- [x] Entity Structural Changes with O(1) time complexity (per individual change).
- [x] Entity-Component Queries with O(1) runtime lookup time complexity.

- [x] No code generation and no reflection required.

## ⏩ Nimble: _**fenn**ecs_ benchmarks

Preliminary (WIP) benchmarks suggest you can expect to process over 2 million components per millisecond on a 2020 CPU.

We worked hard to minimize allocations, and if using static anonymous methods or delegates, even with uniform parameters, the ECS iterates Entities allocation-free.

_**fenn**ecs_ provides a variety of ways to iterate over and modify components, to offer a good balance of control and elegance without compromising too much. 

Here are some raw results from our WIP benchmark suite, from the Vector3 operations parts, better ones soon.
(don't @ us)

> Example: Allocation-free enumeration of a million entities with a System.Numerics.Vector3 component, calculating a cross product against a uniform value, and writing the result back to memory. Processing methods included parallel jobs with different batch/chunk sizes and single threaded runs.

------------------------

## 📅 Future Roadmap

- 🟦 Unity Support: Planned for when Unity is on .NET 8 or later, and C# 12 or later. Or when we can't wait any longer.
- ✅ ~~_**fenn**ecs_ as a NuGet package~~ (done!)
- 🟦 _**fenn**ecs_ as a Godot addon
