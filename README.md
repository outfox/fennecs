## About this Project
**fenn**ecs is a free and open source Entity-Component System (ECS) library for .NET, written in C#. 

It integrates with [popular game engines and frameworks](https://fennecs.tech/examples/) or can be used just as well in standalone solutions.

[ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) is a software architecture pattern used to structure application logic, primarily in games and simulations. ECS works by organizing functionality into **systems** that process batches of **components** attached to **entities**. This differs from the common GameObject-Component (or Node) model, where **scripts** are components attached to singular **game objects** that contain both state data and core logic.

[![Traditional Nodes or Game Objects: Intuitive at small scale, hard to optimize, difficult querying, stronger coupling; ECS Approach: Efficient data processing, intrinsically optimized, expressive querying, looser coupling](https://fennecs.tech/img/ecs-darkmode.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system#gh-dark-mode-only)

**fenn**ecs provides a simple, fast, and flexible way to structure your application logic, emphasizing high execution speed and composable, expressive code with minimal boilerplate.


<details>
<summary><h3>The fine print: What <b>fenn</b>ecs is not!</h3> <i>(click to expand)</i></summary>  

### **fenn**ecs is not yet stable. 

Much of its API surface will stay in flux during beta cycles.    

### **fenn**ecs is not recommended for beginning developers.

It is no a game engine, nor a game framework. You still need one of those (but the choice is yours!)

**fenn**ecs isn't a runtime or drop-in optimizer. Instead, it requires logic designed for it from the ground up.

It does not provide game features (like character controllers, transforms, etc.), it's a library that enables you to implement your own (or re-use existing) game logic.

Despite similar names, ECSs predate and have no relation to [Entity Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) (an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping)). 

**fenn**ecs is designed for **general game logic** rather than specialized systems like particle effects, even though those make for popular demonstrations. 

It doesn't (want to) leverage GPUs! It focuses on CPU-side processing, though it can be used to prepare data like [cbuffers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-constants#parameters) for rendering.

**fenn**ecs is fast, but never the fastest: Bespoke solutions (native arrays, compute shaders, etc.) tailored to a specific use case likely outperform it.

## Quickstart
> *Brand new? Try the [cookbook](https://fennecs.tech/cookbook/) for a quick & tasty intro, or [dive into the docs](https://fennecs.tech/docs/)!*</br>
> *Familiar with ECS architectures? Get an [overview](https://fennecs.tech/docs/Concepts.html) of new & unique concepts!*

At the basic level, all you need is a 🧩**component type**, a number of ~~small foxes~~ 🦊**entities**, and a query to ⚙️**iterate and modify** components, occasionally passing in some uniform 💾**data**.
```cs
// Declare a component record. (we can also use most existing value & reference types)
record struct Velocity(Vector3 Value);

// Create a world. (fyi, World implements IDisposable)
var world = new fennecs.World();

// Spawn an entity into the world with a choice of components. (or add/remove them later)
var entity = world.Spawn().Add<Velocity>();

// Queries are cached & we use ultra-lightweight Stream Views to feed data to our code!
var stream = world.Query<Velocity>().Stream();

// Run code on all entities in the query. (exchange 'For' with 'Job' for parallel processing)
stream.For(
    uniform: DeltaTime * 9.81f * Vector3.UnitZ,
    action: (Vector3 uniform, ref Velocity velocity) =>
    {
        velocity.Value -= uniform;
    }
);
```

#### 💢... when we said minimal boilerplate, <em>we meant it.</em>

By any measure, we're talking just a couple of lines to get this gravity feature up and running. Creating the world and query is the only setup – the real slam dunk is how cleanly we built the full actor/gravity logic with barely any ceremonial code in sight.

And there's more: all that simplicity doesn't force any performance trade-offs! You get to have your cake and eat it too with zero confusion or fluff!

------------------------

## 💡Highlights / Design Goals

- [x] Modern C# 12 codebase, targeting .NET 8.
- [x] Full Unit Test coverage.
- [x] Powerfully intuitive ways to access data... _fast!_
- [x] Workloads can be easily parallelized across *and within* Archetypes
- [x] Expressive, queryable relations among Entities themselves & between Entities and Objects
- [x] No code generation and no reflection required.

## ⏩ Nimble: _**fenn**ecs_ benchmarks

Preliminary (WIP) benchmarks suggest you can expect to process over 2 million components per millisecond on a 2020 CPU without even customizing your logic.

Using Doraku's synthetic [Ecs.CSharp.Benchmark](https://github.com/Doraku/Ecs.CSharp.Benchmark/pull/36), fennecs scores among the faster ECS in the benchmark suite.  
*(link goes to PR #36 to reproduce)*

> [!WARNING]
> These are synthetic benchmarks, using a **BETA BUILD** of **fenn**ecs. Real-world performance will vary wildly.
> If you need a production-ready ECS *today*, 9 out of 10 foxes endorse [Friflo.Engine.ECS](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Json.Fliox/tree/main/Engine)👍 and [Flecs.NET](https://github.com/BeanCheeseBurrito/Flecs.NET)👍

Another optimization pass for **fenn**ecs is [on the Roadmap](https://fennecs.tech/misc/Roadmap.html).

## 🥊 Comparisons: Punching above our weight?
So how does _**fenn**ecs_ compare to other ECSs? 

This library is a tiny, tiny ECS with a focus on good performance and great simplicity. But it *cares enough* to provide a few things you might not expect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The idea of _**fenn**ecs_ was to fill the gaps that the author felt working with various established Entity-Component Systems. This is why this matrix is clearly imbalanced, it's a shopping list of things that _**fenn**ecs_ does well and was made to do
well; and things it may aspire to do but compromised on in order to be able to achieve the others.
