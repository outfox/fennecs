# Ok, what the fox? *Another ECS?!*
### :neofox_facepalm: We know... oh, _we know._    

In a tiny nutshell, **fenn**ecs is an archetype-based [🔗Entity Component System (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)  and follows the philofoxy of being small, clever, <u>and</u> fast. While **fenn**ecs are best adapted for their natural habitats of **game** and **simulation** development, scientists agree that foxes like being used! 

By the way, did we mention this project is free & libre open source software?

### Time to get all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed again!
