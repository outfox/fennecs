# Worlds

Worlds represent the universe of Entities and their Components (as well as the component layout, and the Queries that match them). 

![A fennec leaning casually on a World](https://fennecs.tech/img/fennec-world.png)

It is possible to have multiple Worlds, each with its own set of Queries and Entities.
- Entities are unique to a World
- Relations can bridge across Worlds (from fennecs 0.6.0+)
- Component Types are shared between Worlds
- (this facilitates moving entities between Worlds) (planned fennecs 0.6.5+)

![World Example: blue circle labeled world filled with fox emojis with many different traits](https://fennecs.tech/img/diagram-world.png)
*"A world, populated by Entities with different traits (Components)"*

## Instantiation
Imagine making a new universe was as easy as saying *"let there be fennecs"* - well, it is!
::: code-group
```csharp [just a plain world]
// fiat fox! (that's latin for "using fennecs;")
var world = new fennecs.World();
```

```csharp [initial capacity]
// sometimes you know a ballpark upper bound of entities to prepare for!
var world = new fennecs.World(initialCapacity: 1_000_000);
```

```csharp [optional initializers]
// specify some strategies and debug settings in the object initializer
var world = new fennecs.World(initialCapacity: 0)
{
    Name = "very smol foxes world",
    GCBehaviour = GCStrategy.InvokeOnWorldCatchup 
        | GCStrategy.CompactStagnantArchetypes 
        | GCStrategy.DisposeEmptyRelationArchetypes,
}
```

### You can have up to a Billion Entities in a World.
Optimistically, **fenn**ecs might help you handle around 1 or 2 <u>M</u>illion Entities at a reasonable performance level for games, depending on your Component layouts.

::: details :neofox_cry_loud: I WANT MORE!
Listen, Jeff Jr. - the difference between 1 million and 1 billion is pretty much exactly 1 billion. Can you even begin to fathom how much a billion is? ... *sigh* ... sure, we'll chip in a couple more! 

Easy to remember, too - the limit is now your mom's weight and/or phone number:
`1,073,741,824`<br/>
There - *Tres Commas...* happy now?

## What's a World, anyway?

A `fennecs.World` is the root object that contains all your Entities, their Components, Queries, and the data structures that group them. It's the central hub for all things **fenn**ecs in your game or simulation.

::: details :neofox_magnify: BEHIND THE SCENES - Multiple Worlds

Yes, you can have up to 256 of them. Disposing a World returns it to the pool. Instantiate to your heart's content! You usually only need one World... now go ... ... shoo!

::: details DON'T SHOO ME!
There are at least two traditional use cases for multiple worlds:
- a Server/Network World and a Client World on the same machine
- a world with few, highly dynamic Archetypes and many Queries and a world with a more static setup but maybe more Queries and Entities. Adding new Archetypes becomes more expensive the more cached Queries a world has, so splitting them up can be beneficial in some cases.

Each World is a separate, isolated universe of Entities and Components, with its own set of Archetypes and Queries.

Entities know their World, including Entities as parts of Relation Expressions. Cross-World relations are fully supported, and if an Entity Despawns, any Relations to it are automatically cleaned up.

Other than that, Worlds don't know about each other. They're like parallel dimensions, each with its own set of rules and inhabitants.

Entities can't move between Worlds *(yet)*, but copying them over by hand is easy enough.  
(with some caveats in the [Random Tidbits](#random-tidbits-for-nerds) section)

Multiple Worlds become useful when you want strict separation, e.g. for a Server World and a Client World on the same machine. They might also be useful if you want to re-use the same Query creation code with different rules. *(relevant for library authors)*

In Worlds where lots of Archetypes or Queries are created and destroyed, it can also be beneficial to have separate worlds to keep the Query overhead of these operations low. *(we're talking many thousands or millions of operations here - don't prematurely optimize, profile your code and then make an informed decision!)*
:::


## Querying your World

To find and work with Entities, you'll use the World's [QueryBuilder](Queries/index.md) creation methods like `Query()`, `Query<C>()` and its variants. These let you express complex queries to match exactly the Entities you need, using powerful [Match Expressions](/docs/Queries/Matching.md).

```csharp
// Find all Entities with a Position and Velocity component
var query = world.Query<Position, Velocity>().Stream();
```


## Spawning Entities ...
Entities spring to life in a World when you `Spawn()` them:

```csharp
var entity = world.Spawn();
```

You can give them Components either one by one...

```csharp
entity.Add<Position>();
entity.Add<Velocity>();
```

...or using the `EntitySpawner` for a bit of extra âœ¨flairâœ¨:

```csharp
var entities = world.Entity()
    .Add<Position>()
    .Add<Velocity>()
    .Spawn(count: 100); 
```

### ... and completing the Circle of Life! ðŸŒ„

```csharp
// ...Living its best Entity life...

// Suddenly - Despawn!
entity.Despawn();
```
*(various ways to despawn Entities are available, see [CRUD](Queries/CRUD.md) for more!*

## I am become Fox, the Disposer of Worlds

When you're done with a World, disposing of it will clean up all its Entities and Components, and free up most of the resources **fenn**ecs was using for it.  Worlds implement `IDisposable`, this is useful in Games and Tests alike:

::: code-group
```csharp [manually (e.g. game code)]
myWorld.Dispose();
```

```csharp [via using statement (e.g. test code)]
using (var world = new World()) // a whole new world!
{
    // do unit tests in the World  
}  // World is disposed at end of scope!
```
::: tip :neofox_nervous: DON'T PANIC
You do not have to dispose worlds unless you want a clean slate. **fenn**ecs (or rather, the .NET Runtime) will clean up after itself when your program exits, and there can actually be an advantage to keeping a World around for the duration of your game or simulation - all your Queries are already compiled, most Archetypes exist, the IdentityPool is pre-allocated, etc., etc.

## Random Tidbits for Nerds

::: details :neofox_magnify: BEHIND THE SCENES - Archetypes

Under the hood, a World stores Entities with identical Component setups together in data structures called ==Archetypes==. This keeps **fenn**ecs fast as a fox, letting it blaze through hundreds of thousands of Entities in a flash.

You usually don't need to think about Archetypes yourself - **fenn**ecs handles them automagically based on the Components you give to each Entity.
:::

::: details :neofox_magnify: BEHIND THE SCENES - IdentityPool
Entities have an internal Id, their Identity, which they receive from - and return to - an internal pool. There, the Identities recycled when Entities despawn.

Identiy stores an internal Generation number that prevents an Entity's successor from being mistaken for the real McCoy.

*"Wait, it's all Identities? - Always has been!"*

#### Entity-Entity relations **do care and know about other worlds.** 

- Essentially your Relation keys are unique across world boundaries, and if an Entity despawns, any Relations targeting it in any world are cleaned up accordingly (the components are removed from their respective Entities). 

- Entities cannot automagically move between worlds yet, but when that feature comes, their Relations will be kept intact. You currently have to do all that housekeeping yourself if you need this functionality.

#### Keyed Components don't care.

Keys are just snapshots of momentary Hash values. This means if something has the same Hash and Type in multiple worlds, they will be considered the same key. 

- Keys can trivially move between worlds if needed, they are just values; no cleanup is needed.

#### Entity-Object links work as expected, too.
- And yay! This is another one of their main uses, for example a Network Socket, Asset Provider, or Sound System might be a good candidate for an Object Link used by Entities in multiple Worlds.
